\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
    \item{What is the purpose of the cell cycle?}
        \begin{solution}
            \invis
            \begin{itemize}
                \item{Sustain the processes for cell division to occur.}
                \item{Cell growth; duplication of DNA and duplication of organelles.}
                \item{Maintain regular cell function.}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{solution}

    \item{Define the term ``interphase'' and describe its purpose.}
        \begin{solution}
            It refers to the period of time in which the cell carries out its regular cell functions. The purpose of interphase is to get the cell ready to divide (growth of the cell, duplication of the cell, duplication of DNA, duplication of organelles).
        \end{solution}

    \item{
        \begin{2qu}
            \item{What is mitosis?}
                \begin{solution}
                    This is when a single parent cell divides into two new daughter cells. The parent cells and daughter cells have the same DNA.
                \end{solution}
            \item{Why is mitosis important to the cell?}
                \begin{solution}
                    \textbf{Cell reproduction}; making new cells. \textbf{Growth}; optimization of cell surface area to cell volume ratio. High surface area to volume ratio is important. A high surface area to volume ratio maintains that nutrients can enter the cell efficiently and that waste can leave the cell efficiently.
                \end{solution}
        \end{2qu}}

        \item{Define and distinguish between the following terms: chromosomes, centromere, and sister chromatids.}

                                \item{The sister chromatids are separated in mitosis during anaphase.}
                            \end{itemize}
                        \item{ \textbf{Centromere:}

\section{Cancer}
\begin{definition}[Cancer]
    This is a group of diseases in which cells grow and divides uncontrollably. See Figure \ref{fig:cancer}.
\end{definition}

This is caused by mutations to the DNA within cells which can allow rapidgrowth, fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth, or make errors when correcting DNA. Mutations are inherited or caused by environmental factors (i.e. radiation, viruses, carcinogens, etc.).

\subsection{Stages of Cancer}
% TODO
\textbf{Stage 0}: cancer cells remain in place to form a mass cells called a tumour.\\ 
\textbf{Stage 1:} small tumour has not grown deeply into nearby tissues and has not spread to lymph nodes.\\ 
\textbf{Stage 2 $\&$ 3:} larger tumours have grown deeply into nearby tissue and may have spread to lymph nodes.\\
\textbf{Stage 4:} cancer has spread to other organs or parts of the body (metastasis).

\section{Stem Cells Case Study Mini-Assignment}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
    \item{What is the difference between embryonic stem cells adn adult stem cells?}
    \begin{solution}
        Embryonic stem cells:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Embryonic stem cells exist only right after the fertilization of an egg.}
            \item{Embryonic stem cells can specialize into any kind of body cell, be it epithelial cell, a red blood cell, nerve cell, bone cell, etc.}
            \item{Adults don't have embryonic stem cells.}
        \end{itemize}
        Adult stem cells:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Adult blood stem cells are located in the bone marrow AND in the peripheral blood.}
            \item{Adult blood stem cells can only differentiate into either red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}

    \item{Based on the article, how would you describe what cancer is?}
    \begin{solution}
            As a result of some kind of mutation in the cellular DNA, this causes healthy cell checkpoints to become dysfunctional and causes uncontrollable cell growth/division. This uncontrollable growth eventually materializes as a tumor in the healthy tissue
    \end{solution}

    \item{Conduct some research on the following cancer treatments: chemotherapy, radiation, therapy, and surgery. Do you think that differentiation therapy has any benefits over these known treatments? Explain your reasoning.}
        \begin{solution}
            \invis
            \begin{itemize}
                \item{Chemotherapy is targeted to kill cancer cells, but in the administration of chemotherapy, the drugs are targeting the healthy cells as well. Though chemotherapy may be effective in killing the cancer cells, it also damages healthy cells, which can lead to adverse effects such as nausea, hair loss, and cdecreasing in immune function.}
                \item{Radiation therapy, uinless specifically localized, can also have adverse effects on surrounding healthy tissue.}
                \item{Differentiation therapy is much more targeted towards turning cancer cells back into normal cells, so the use of toxic chemical is not necessary. This can decrease the number of adverse effects as well as results of this treatment.}
            \end{itemize}
            With this new kind of treatment, it could open many doors to groundbreaking cancer research and therapy; possible high mobilization of this particular kind of research (can lead to scientific discoveries).
